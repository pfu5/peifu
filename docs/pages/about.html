                <p>Hi, I’m Pei, a Mechatronics Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a passion for automation and precision systems. I began my career in the building design industry, where I designed medical and biomedical research facilities that balanced complex technical requirements with structured project management. My drive to make a more direct impact on innovation led me to pursue a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in robotics and controls. Today, I work in the metrology industry, where I design, build, and refine industrial automation systems that advance accuracy and efficiency in EV battery quality control. </p>
                <p>During my undergrad years as a machinist, I discovered the joy of creating things from the ground up. That experience sparked a lifelong passion for hands-on learning—whether it’s garment design, sewing, furniture making, woodworking, or painting, I’m always finding new ways to create and build.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to check out Projects page for engineering work and Art page for hobbies!</p>
