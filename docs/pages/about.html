            <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Pei Fu and I am a Mechanical Engineer with interest in Robotics and Controls. I worked in the building design industry designing medical and bio research facilities before getting my ME masters with concentration in robotics and controls. Currently, I work as a R&D scientist for an industrial connector company, and I enjoy electro-mechanical projects that require hands-on building, prototyping, and debugging.</p>
            <p>When I got a job as a machinist during undergrad, I came to the revelation that "I could make anything!" Since then, Iâ€™ve lived by the motto of why buy it for 7 dollars when I can spend 70 dollars on supplies and make it myself. These rabbit holes have materialized in forms of garment designing, sewing, furniture design, woodworking, and painting.</p>
            <p>Please check out Projects page for engineering work and Art page for hobbies!</p>
