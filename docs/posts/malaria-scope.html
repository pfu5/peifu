            <p>This project centered around the automatic infected cell counting microscope for malaria diagnosis developed at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub’s bioengineering team, where I worked as an bioengineering intern. Traditionally, in addition to clinical diagnosis, malaria is diagnosed with microscopic examination of patient’s blood sample, where a trained personnel physically counts the number of parasite infected red blood cells. With the automatic counting microscope, it eliminates the long and arduous nature of the current state of the art technique. Furthermore, label-free means that the samples were examined without the dyeing process commonly used for enhancing parasites visibility. By directly examining the samples un-labeled, it avoids killing the cells/parasites and shortens the preparation process on top of the time saved through automatic microscopic diagnosis. </p>
            <p>My project’s two main objectives were quality control for the consumable production and the microscope build. First, the consumables are manufactured out of laser-cut acrylic with laminated ink channel and coverslip; the quality of these consumables are crucial to blood cell flow during the diagnosis. Poor quality consumables can lead to ruptured cells and leaking samples, hence there is a need for systematic lot tracking. Next, the design of the microscope is meant to be publish as open-source material, hence evaluating the assembly procedure without the influence of the initial design knowledge becomes helpful in this process.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The program written in Python takes in user inputs, sends the information to a Google sheet, and generates a printable PDF that aligns with the chips on each sheet. The PDF is printed directly onto the acrylic layer, which indicates the sample port location and the serial number for each consumable. </p>

        <p>A malaria microscope was built from scratch following the existing build guide. The process included 3D printing, laser cutting, machining, soldering, wiring, and 
        debugging the final product. The build guide was revised throughout based on the build experience, while fit issues and wire management were also addressed. Lastly, the entire system was validated through a debugging process that tested out every single sensors and actuators. </p>
