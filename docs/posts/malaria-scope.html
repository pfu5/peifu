        <h2>Context</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This project was centers around the automatic infected blood cell counting microscope for malaria disease diagnosis developed at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Label-free meaning the samples were examined without the dyeing process commonly used for enhancing parasites. By directly examining the samples un-labeled, it avoids killing the cells/parasites and shortens the preparation process. </p>
            <p>This projectâ€™s two main objectives were quality control for the consumable production and the microscope build. First, the consumables are manufactured out of laser-cut acrylic with laminated ink channel and coverslip; the quality of these consumables are crucial to blood cell flow during the diagnosis. Poor quality consumables can lead to ruptured cells and leaking samples, hence there is a need for systematic lot tracking. Next, the design of the microscope is meant to be publish as open-source material, hence evaluating the assembly procedure without the influence of the initial design knowledge becomes helpful in this process.</p>
